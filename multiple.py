# Multiple assignments allow us to assign multiple vriables in one line of code
#lets take a bunch of variables below 
#name = 'fren'
#age = 22
#smart = True 
#now lets print these separately 
#print(name)
#print(age)
#print(smart)
#now lets print it in 1 line of code using multiple assignment 
name , age , smart = 'fren', 22, True
#now if we print it it should give us the same results.
#print(name, age, smart)
#lets try with 5 variables having same values 
me = 30 
she = 30 
you = 30 
them = 30 
us =30 
#now lets put it in line of code
me = she = you = them = us = 30 
print(me )
print(she)
print(us )
print (them)
#nciely prints all of them.
