z, x, c = map(int, input().split())

# Update your code below this line to compare c with z and x
if c > x or c > z :
    print("PASS")
else:
    print("fail")
#The 'or' operator is another logical operator in Python that allows you to combine multiple conditions.
It returns 'True' if at least one of the conditions is true, and 'False' if all the conditions are false.
#solved for the questions - Write a program which does the following

Compute and output the following for each tuple

z, 
�
x and 
�
c
"PASS" if 
�
c is greater than either 
�
x or

Otherwise print "FAIL" in every other case
